  <h1>Solve this</h1>
  <h3>Write a JavaScript snippet that can be run in the console of the browser that does the following:</h3>
  <p>Extracts the number of items in the cart, the cart total, and the item images from the page.</p>
<p>Store them in variables. Create a trigger that activates when the user scrolls into the bottom 10% of the page. </p>
<p>The trigger should show a centered overlay on top of the site that displays the information gathered above and two buttons. </p>
<p>One button should close the overlay and the other should take the user to the cart page. It should have a style consistent with the website. Design matters. Behind the overlay add a semiÂ­transparent black background that obscures the site. The overlay should be able to trigger multiple times if dismissed.</p>
  <h3>BONUS</h3> 1. Explain potential problems that could arise if this snippet had more or less than the 2 items in the cart. How would you address those problems?
